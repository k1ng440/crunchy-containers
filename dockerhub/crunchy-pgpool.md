The crunchy-pgpool container executes the [pgPool II](http://www.pgpool.net/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page) utility. pgPool can be used to provide a smart PostgreSQL-aware proxy to a PostgreSQL cluster, both primary and replica, so that applications only have to work with a single database connection.

## Container Specifications

See the [official documentation](https://crunchydata.github.io/crunchy-containers/container-specifications/crunchy-pgpool/) for more details regarding how the container operates and is customized.

## Examples
