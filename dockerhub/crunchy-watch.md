The crunchy-watch container essentially does a health check on a primary database container and performs a failover sequence if the primary is not reached. The watch container has access to a service account that is used inside the container to issue commands to OpenShift.

**Note**: Crunchy Watch currently only works on Kubernetes and OpenShift.

## Container Specifications
