[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) is a multi-dimensional time series data model with an elastic query language. Overall, itâ€™s reliable, manageable, and operationally simple for efficiently storing and analyzing data for large-scale environments. It scraps metrics from exporters such as the ones utilized by the crunchy-collect container.
